☕️ Coffee Sales Data Analysis & Dashboard Creation 📊

In this project, I analyzed coffee sales data using advanced Excel functions to extract meaningful insights. Key tasks included utilizing XLOOKUP 🔍 and INDEX MATCH for data retrieval, implementing multiplication formulas ✖️ to calculate sales, and applying multiple IF functions for conditional logic. I also worked with date 📅 and number formatting 🔢, detected duplicates 🔁, and converted ranges to tables for better data management. Additionally, I built interactive Pivot Tables 📈 and Pivot Charts 📊, and incorporated timelines ⏳ and slicers for dynamic reporting. Finally, I developed a comprehensive dashboard 📑 to present key performance metrics and trends. This project helped enhance my skills in data analysis, visualization, and dashboard design in Excel.
